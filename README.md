## Roman Numerals converter assignment (Jon Braz)

(This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).)

I've created a simple converter between Roman Numerals and Arabic Integers.

Assumptions:

- Only handles integers from 1 to 3999 (numerals outside this range aren't standardized)
- Error messages are present but relatively simple
- Targeting schoolchildren old enough to have a decent vocabulary for instructions / error messages
- Tests were written for the RomanNumerals helper only

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
For this assignment, I've written tests for the RomanNumerals helper only.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
